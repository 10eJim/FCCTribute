            <h3 id="headline">Highlights on Isaac Asimov:</h3>
            <li>Prolific American writer and professor of Biochemistry who published more than 500 books in nearly every category of the Dewey Decimal Categorization system.</li>
            <li>Best known for his work as a science fiction author, Asimov wrote and published an extensive body of short stories and novels.</li>
            <li>His Robot series of novels introduced the famous <em>Three Laws of Robotics</em>, often referenced today in discussions of the emerging issues with robotics.</li>
              <div>
                <ol>
                  <h4>The Three Laws of Robotics</h4>
                  <li>A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.</li>
                  <li>A robot must obey the orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.</li>
                  <li>A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Laws.</li>
                </ol>
              </div>
            <li>In his <em>Foundation</em> series, Asimov introduced the concept of psychohistory, the study and prediction of mass psychology across eons.  Asimov's modeling of mass psychology and the attempts to modify and influence mass behavior is still relevant, perhaps even more so, today.</li>

          <blockquote>
            <p>"Through a series of developments of absorbing lack of interest (as far as these pages are concerned), I found myself doing research on a biochemical topic. In that area of study I obtained my Ph.D., and in no time at all I was teaching biochemistry at a medical school.

              But even that was too wide a subject. From books to nonfiction, to science, to chemistry, to biochemistryâ€”and not yet enough. The orchard had to be narrowed down further. To do research, I had to find myself a niche within biochemistry, so I began work on nucleic acids...
              
              And at about that point, I rebelled! I could not stand the claustrophobia that clamped down upon me. I looked with horror, backward and forward across the years, at a horizon that was narrowing down and narrowing down to so petty a portion of the orchard. What I wanted was all the orchard, or as much of it as I could cover in a lifetime of running...
              
              I have never been sorry for my stubborn advance toward generalization. To be sure, I can't wander in detail through all the orchard, any more than anyone else can, no matter how stupidly determined I may be to do so. Life is far too short and the mind is far too limited. But I can float over the orchard as in a balloon."</p>
            <div>-- Asimov, describing his insatiable desire for holistic knowledge.</div>
